##  Learning outcomes  


`Apart from learning a whole lot about matrices, you will become familiar with the Math library, recursion, and the many ways of using nested lists in practice.`  


<h2>Objectives</h2>

1. Add matrices
2. Multiply matrix by a constant
3. Multiply matrices
4. Transpose matrix
5. Calculate a determinant
0. Exit

```
In some cases the inverse of a matrix does not exist. In such cases, program outputs a warning message.
